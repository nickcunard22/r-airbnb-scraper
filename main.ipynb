Very responsive, very friendly.\\\\n\\\\nThe Questionable:\\\\n\\\\n* The space doesn't match the photos - specifically, the kitchen and the room itself.\\\\n* I book a room and am given instructions to check into it. Three hours before check-in, they said they \\\\\\\"made a mistake\\\\\\\" and I would be in a different room. No problem, but it's not the room I booked nor does it match any of the photos of any of the available rooms.\\\\n* Someone else was in the room I had booked - I don't know why.\\\\n* \\\\\\\"Parking on site\\\\\\\" was actually parking down another street and walking over - not a big deal but not as advertised\\\\n* Bed sheet has hairs all over it. I ask for a clean one, am given a (stained but washed) mattress topper (not a fitted sheet) also with hairs on it. I let them know and am given a refund of the cleaning fee, which I appreciate but did not ask for,\\\\n* The bed itself is not made - I had to \\\\\\\"make\\\\\\\" the blanket and there were no other sheets.\\\\n* There were many other small things but they all generally fall under the place being dirty and grimy - visible stains/mystery substances on walls and doors, bad smell, dirty shared kitchen (which might be the other guest), a hole in the bathroom wall with a hanger instead of a towel rack.\\\\n\\\\nI've been really lenient with hosts and always choosing to find reasons to err on a higher rating, but I feel this is a situation where the place doesn't match what I thought I booked. Reading though the guest reviews, there are a few who mention the same things, although most rave about how clean the place is.\\\\n\\\\nI hate the idea of leaving a bad rating but if you were a host, how would you justify this even being 4 stars?\\\"\"\n",
